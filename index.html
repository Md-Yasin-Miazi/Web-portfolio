        <p>Web developers are responsible for programming the code that 'tells' a website how to function. They build websites that are 'user friendly', which means they are easy to navigate for those using them. They also build functions within a website â€” for example, a form to capture an e-mail or to provide a newsletter, a paywall to capture payment details, or a message to thank a customer for their business.</p>
